## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). In the worst case, we will have to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.

- The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1). During a search, we are not allocating any additional space.
