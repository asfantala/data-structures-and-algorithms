# Challenge Title
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
### Hashtables 
### Emplement a Hash Table
- Create a class called HashTable and Node
- Node class should have key, value, and next properties
- HashTable class should have add, get, contains, and hash methods
- add method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed
- get method should accept a key, and return the value from the table
- contains method should accept a key, and return a boolean indicating if the key exists in the table already
- hash method should accept a key, and return an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency

|Method	|Time| 	Space|
|---|---|----|
|set	|O(1)|	O(1)|
|get|	O(1)|	O(1)|
|has|	O(1)|	O(1)|
|keys|	O(n)|	O(n)|
|hash|	O(1)|	O(1)|
|add|O(1)|O(1)   |
