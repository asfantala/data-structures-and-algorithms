    Given two hash maps, return a new data structure that holds the results of a LEFT JOIN operation.

        synonyms: A hash map that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

    Returns:
        The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
