    If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', or '['), it is pushed onto the stack.
    
    If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', or ']'), it checks if the stack is empty or the corresponding    
    opening bracket doesn't match the top of the stack. If either of these conditions is true, it returns False.
    
    After iterating through all characters, it checks if there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the stack. If so,     
    it returns False.
    
    If the stack is empty and all brackets are balanced, it returns True.
